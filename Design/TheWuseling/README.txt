This is the treatment for the game "The Wuseling" it originally started with the name Project WBB.

For this treatment, I wrote and defined everything, except for the Sound and Music parts, which I still influenced via design and sample songs.

For the design process, I mostly started by defining our general wants and dont wants of the project. What does every member want to try and what does nobody want to do. 

This left us with an action game, the general theme and a focus on chaos. From that point onward I started designing, via game analysis, checking similar games and developing a small narrative guide, to enable easier definition of mechanics,
items and spells, as I could just translate real world items into abilities.

Due to time constraints however and the unfortunate case of someone leaving the team, the project would never reach its true potential.
